<h1>Elo System Overview</h1>
    
    <h2>Initial Ratings:</h2>
    <p>Every participant starts with a base ELO rating of 1500.</p>
    
    <h2>Rating Calculation After Each Competition:</h2>
    
    <h3>Determining Actual Scores (SA):</h3>
    <p>The score is calculated based on the participant's finishing position using the formula:</p>
    <p>SA = <sup>n-r</sup>&frasl;<sub>n-1</sub>, where n is the number of competitors, and r is the competitor's rank.</p>
    <p>This gives the winner (1st place) the highest score and scales down linearly to the last place.</p>
    
    <h3>Calculating Expected Scores (EA):</h3>
    <p>The expected score is calculated based on the participant's current ELO rating and either the ratings of their specific opponents or the average rating in the competition, using the formula:</p>
    <p>EA = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1 + 10^((average - RA) / 400)</sub>, where RA is the participant's rating, and average is the average rating of the competition.</p>
    
    <h2>Updating Ratings:</h2>
    <p>Participants' ratings are updated after the competition based on their actual versus expected scores. The new rating is calculated as:</p>
    <p>RA' = RA + K Ã— (SA - EA), where K is a constant determining the maximum adjustment (we use K=30).</p>
    
    <h2>Adjustments for Competition Difficulty:</h2>
    <p>Ratings are adjusted more significantly when a participant with a lower rating outperforms expectations in a higher-rated competition, and vice versa.</p>
